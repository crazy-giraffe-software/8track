## Description

* Nidec 24H677
* DC12V PWM 3-Phase Brushless Motor 
* 2 Channel Pulse Signal Output
* 4mm Shart

This is a great little motor with plenty of torque to run an 8-track. Also it's a great size, very close to the size of 8-track motors making it easy to fit into existing enclosures.

The 24H677 is a 3-phase brushless DC motor with a built-in driver. It accepts a faily wide range of input voltages but requires a 5V suppoly to power the internal driver.

It needs speed controller and direction selection, hence this design. Direction selection is controlled by a solder jumper and speed is controlled by R15, a multi-turn trim pot.

The pulse signal output allows the circuit to detect speed and direction (direction detection not needed in this case) allowing for the firmware to keep it running at a constant speed.

For the pulley, I've been using 4mm shaft couplers. You can find these on EBay or Amazon pretty easily. They have a 4mm input for the shaft and are about 12mm (1/2") in diameter, making them about the right size for the 8-track motor pulley. They work with flat belts pretty nicely.
