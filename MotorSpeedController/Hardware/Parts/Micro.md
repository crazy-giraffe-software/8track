## Description
This design uses the ATMega32U4. Overkill? Sure. 

However, I wanted to make it easy to use, i.e. USB connection and a bootloader, and the 32U4 is a great way to get USB support for a small part count. This makes it easy to load with Arduino. See the firmware folder for board
definition details.
